- Hi, I’m @DevPahanLankage
- I’m a dedicated full-stack developer with a passion for creating seamless digital experiences. Coding is more than just a job for me—it’s a craft I’m constantly refining. With expertise in HTML, CSS, C#, Python, MySQL, and JavaScript, I love tackling a wide variety of projects, whether it’s breathing life into a creative design, building software solutions, or diving into the intricacies of database management. My problem-solving approach is thoughtful and strategic: I take time to fully understand the challenge at hand, break it down into manageable parts, and build solutions step by step. I’m a strong believer in collaboration, and I thrive in team environments where ideas flow freely. Patience and perseverance are my strengths—I won’t stop working until I’ve hit my target for the day. My long-term goal is to have an answer for every challenge that comes my way as a developer. Outside of coding, I keep myself energized by hitting the gym, vibing to tech house and progressive music, and enjoying a night out with friends. Balancing focus and fun helps fuel my creativity and drive to keep improving
- Currently grinding React.js and C#
